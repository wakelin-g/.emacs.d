* New directions in ALS Management

#+begin_example
Description: ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with no known cure. Current treatments are limited, typically extending life expectancy by only 3â€“6 months. In this seminar, I discuss how various pharmacological antagonists improve symptoms, slow disease progression, and extend lifespan. Possible mechanisms and future directions are also explored.
